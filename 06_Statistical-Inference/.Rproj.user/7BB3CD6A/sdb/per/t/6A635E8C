From\n\nthe plot, we can see that as the dose increases, the lent of the tooth tend to \nbe longer as well and this trend is true for both supplement categories. At the \nsame dose level, the supplement OJ seems to have a greater effect on tooth \nlength, although, as the dose increases, the difference between OJ and VC decreases\n\n## Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose.\n\n1. Tooth growth by supplement\nTo compare the tooth growth by supplement, we can Perform a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis: OJ and VC do not have a statistically significant difference in their effect on tooth growth. The results are as follows:\n\n```{r}\ntest1 <- t.test(len ~ supp,data=ToothGrowth)\ntest1\n```\n\nThe p-value of  `r test1$p.value` is suggests that we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that OJ and VC do not have a statistically significant effect on tooth growth. The same conclusion can also be drawn by interpreting the confidence interval of `r test1$conf.int` for mean(OJ)-mean(VC), which contains zero.\n\n2. Tooth growth by dose\nSimiliarly, to compare the tooth growth by dose, we can Perform a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis: dose do not have a statistically significant difference in their effect on tooth growth. For this analysis, we will ignore the type of supplement and subset the three dosage levels into groups for the hypothesis test. For simplicity, the full results are not printed but rather the p-values and confidence intervals of each test. The results are as follows:\n\n```{r}\ndose12 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(0.5, 1.0))\ndose13 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(0.5, 2.0))\ndose23 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(1.0, 2.0))\n\ntest2a <- t.test(len ~ dose, data=dose12 )\ntest2b <- t.test(len ~ dose, data=dose13)\ntest2c <- t.test(len ~ dose, data=dose23)\n\ntest2 <- data.frame(p.value = c(test2a$p.value, test2b$p.value, test2c$p.value),\n                    conf.int.lower = c(test2a$conf.int[1],\n                                                  test2b$conf.int[1],\n                                                  test2c$conf.int[1]),\n                    conf.int.upper = c(test2a$conf.int[2],\n                                                  test2b$conf.int[2],\n                                                  test2c$conf.int[2]),\n                    row.names = c(\"Test A\", \"Test B\", \"Test C\"))\n\ntest2\n```\n\n**Test for dose levels 0.5 and 1.0 (Test A)**: With p-value of `r test2[1,1]`, as well as the confidence interval of [`r test2[1,2]`, `r test2[1,3]`], we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in tooth length between dosages of 0.5 and 1.0.\n\n**Test for dose levels 0.5 and 2.0 (Test B)**: With p-value of `r test2[2,1]`, as well as the confidence interval of [`r test2[2,2]`, `r test2[2,3]`], we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in tooth length between dosages of 0.5 and 2.0.\n\n**Test for dose levels 1.0 and 2.0 (Test c)**: With p-value of `r test2[3,1]`, as well as the confidence interval of [`r test2[3,2]`, `r test2[3,3]`], we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in tooth length between dosages of 1.0 and 2.0.\n\n## Conclusions and the assumptions needed\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n- When ignoring dose levels, there is no statistically significant difference in the tooth growth between the supplement types.\n- When ignoring the supplement types, there is a statistically significant difference in tooth length between the dose levels, with higher doses resulting in longer teeth.\n- When considering both factors:\n    - At the dosage levels 0.5 and 1.0, OJ has a statistically significant effect on tooth length comparing to VC\n    - However, as the dosage increases to 2.0, the difference is no longer significant\n\n**Assumptions:**\nIn the tests and analysis performed, we assume that the variances between the separate populations tested are different (used the default var.equal = FALSE for all the t tests). Also, we assume that the populations are independent and random.",
