Their first examination considers only subjects \n#' that received the medication at baseline then two weeks later. The data are \n#' as follows (SBP in mmHg)\n#' \n#' |Subject  |Baseline |Week2 |\n#' ===========================\n#' |1        |140      |132   |\n#' |2        |138      |135   |\n#' |3        |150      |151   |\n#' |4        |148      |146   |\n#' |5        |135      |130   |\n#' \n#' Consider testing the hypothesis that there was a mean reduction in blood \n#' pressure? Give the P-value for the associated two sided T test.\nbaseline <- c(140, 138, 150, 148, 135)\nweek2 <- c(132, 135, 151, 146, 130)\nans1 <- t.test(baseline, week2, paired = T)$p.value\nans <- list(ans1 = ans1)\nrm(list = setdiff(ls(), \"ans\"))\n\n#' 2. A sample of 9 men yielded a sample average brain volume of 1,100cc and a \n#' standard deviation of 30cc. What is the complete set of values of μ0 that a \n#' test of H0:μ=μ0 would fail to reject the null hypothesis in a two sided 5% \n#' Students t-test?\navg <- 1100; sd <- 30; s <- 9\nans2 <- avg + c(1, -1)*qt(0.025, s-1)*sd/sqrt(s)\nans <- c(ans, ans2 = list(ans2))\nrm(list = setdiff(ls(), \"ans\"))\n\n#' 3. Researchers conducted a blind taste test of Coke versus Pepsi. Each of \n#' four people was asked which of two blinded drinks given in random order that\n#' they preferred. The data was such that 3 of the 4 people chose Coke. \n#' Assuming that this sample is representative, report a P-value for a test of \n#' the hypothesis that Coke is preferred to Pepsi using a one sided exact test.\nans3 <- binom.test(x = 3, n = 4, alternative = \"greater\")$p.value #Approach it as a binomial test\nans <- c(ans, ans3 = list(ans3))\nrm(list = setdiff(ls(), \"ans\"))\n\n#' 4. Infection rates at a hospital above 1 infection per 100 person days at \n#' risk are believed to be too high and are used as a benchmark. A hospital that\n#' had previously been above the benchmark recently had 10 infections over the \n#' last 1,787 person days at risk. About what is the one sided P-value for the \n#' relevant test of whether the hospital is *below* the standard?\nans4 <-poisson.test(10, 1787, 1/100, alternative = \"less\")$p.value\nans <- c(ans, ans4 = list(ans4))\nrm(list = setdiff(ls(), \"ans\"))\n\n#' 5. Suppose that 18 obese subjects were randomized, 9 each, to a new diet pill\n#' and a placebo. Subjects’ body mass indices (BMIs) were measured at a baseline\n#' and again after having received the treatment or placebo for four weeks. \n#' The average difference from follow-up to the baseline (followup - baseline) \n#' was −3 kg/m2 for the treated group and 1 kg/m2 for the placebo group. The \n#' corresponding standard deviations of the differences was 1.5 kg/m2 for the \n#' treatment group and 1.8 kg/m2 for the placebo group. Does the change in BMI \n#' appear to differ between the treated and placebo groups? Assuming normality \n#' of the underlying data and a common population variance, give a pvalue for a \n#' two sided t test.\ns <- 9;avg.tr <- -3; avg.pl <- 1; sd.tr <- 1.5; sd.pl <- 1.8\nse <- sqrt(sd.tr^2/s + sd.pl^2/s)\ntstatis <- (avg.tr - avg.pl)/se\np <- pt(tstatis, df = 2*s - 2)\nans <- c(ans, ans5 = \"Less than 0.01\")\nrm(list = setdiff(ls(), \"ans\"))\n\n#' 6. Brain volumes for 9 men yielded a 90% confidence interval of 1,077 cc to \n#'1,123 cc. Would you reject in a two sided 5% hypothesis test of H0: u = 1078?\n\n#' 1078 falls in the range.
