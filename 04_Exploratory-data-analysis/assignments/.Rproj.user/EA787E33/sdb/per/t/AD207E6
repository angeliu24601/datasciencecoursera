Which of the following is a principle of analytic graphics?\n## no  - Only do what your tools allow you to do\n## no  - Show box plots (univariate summaries)\n## yes - Show comparisons\n## no  - Don't plot more than two variables at at time\n## no  - Make judicious use of color in your scatterplots\n\n## 2. What is the role of exploratory graphs in data analysis?\n## yes - They are typically made very quickly.\n## - Only a few are constructed.\n## - Axes, legends, and other details are clean and exactly detailed.\n## - They are made for formal presentations.\n\n## 3. Which of the following is true about the base plotting system?\n## no  - Margins and spacings are adjusted automatically depending on\n##       the type of plot and the data\n## no  - Plots are typically created with a single function call\n## yes - Plots are created and annotated with separate functions\n## - The system is most useful for conditioning plots\n\n## 4. Which of the following is an example of a valid graphics device in R?\n## yes - A PDF file\n## - A socket connection\n## - The keyboard\n## - A file folder\n\n## 5. Which of the following is an example of a vector graphics device in R?\n## - JPEG\n## yes - Postscript\n## - GIF\n## - PNG\n## - TIFF\n\n## 6. Bitmapped file formats can be most useful for\n## - Plots that require animation or interactivity\n## no  - Plots that may need to be resized\n## yes - Scatterplots with many many points\n## - Plots that are not scaled to a specific resolution\n\n## 7. Which of the following functions is typically used to add elements\n## to a plot in the base graphics system?\n## yes - text()\n## - boxplot()\n## - hist()\n## - plot()\n \n## 8. Which function opens the screen graphics device on Windows?\n## yes - windows()\n## - jpeg()\n## - postscript()\n## - xfig()\n\n## 9. What does the 'pch' option to par() control?\n## - the line width in the base graphics system\n## - the orientation of the axis labels on the plot\n## - the size of the plotting symbol in a scatterplot\n## yes - the plotting symbol/character in the base graphics system\n## \n## 10. If I want to save a plot to a PDF file, which of the following \n## is a correct way of doing that?\n## yes - Construct the plot on the screen device and then copy it to a PDF file\n##   with dev.copy2pdf()\n## - Construct the plot on the PNG device with png(), \n##   then copy it to a PDF with dev.copy2pdf().\n## - Open the PostScript device with postscript(), construct the plot, \n##   then close the device with dev.off().\n## - Open the screen device with quartz(), construct the plot, \n##   and then close the device with dev.off().",
